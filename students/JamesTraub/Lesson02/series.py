# Create a new module series.py in the lesson02 folder in your student folder.
# In it, add a function called fibonacci.
# The function should have one parameter, n.
# The function should return the nth value in the fibonacci series (starting with zero index)
# Ensure that your function has a well-formed docstring
# Note that the fibinacci series is naturally recursive â€“ the value is defined by previous values:

# fib(n) = fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
