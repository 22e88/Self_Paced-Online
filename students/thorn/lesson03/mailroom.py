"""First, factor your script into separate functions. Each of the above tasks can be accomplished by a series of steps. Write discreet functions that accomplish individual steps and call them.

Second, use loops to control the logical flow of your program. Interactive programs are a classic use-case for the while loop.

Of course, input() will be useful here.

Put the functions you write into the script at the top.

Put your main interaction into an if __name__ == '__main__' block.

Finally, use only functions and the basic Python data types youâ€™ve learned about so far. There is no need to go any farther than that for this assignment."""
