def exchange_first_last(seq):
    # Takes seq as argument, returns copy of sequence where first and last items exchanged
    return (seq[-1] + seq[1:-2] + seq[0])


def every_other_removed(seq):
    # Takes seq as argument, returns copy of sequence where every other item removed

def first_4_last_4(seq):
    # Takes seq as argument, returns copy of sequence where the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in between

def reverse_seq(seq):
    # Takes seq as argument, returns copy of sequence with the elements reversed

def shuffle_thirds(seq):
    # Takes seq as argument, returns copy of sequence with the middle third, then last third, then the first third in the new order
