# Lesson 2 - Computing Fibonacci and Lucas Series

def fibonacci(n):
    """Compute Fibonacci Series, return the nth value"""
    first_num = 0
    second_num = 1
    # Return the nth value of Fib series


def lucas(n):
    """Compute Lucas Series, return the nth value"""
    first_num = 2
    second_num = 1
    # Returns nth value of the lucas number Series


def sum_series(n, first_num = 0, second_num = 1):
    # Add docstring
    # Required parameter, n, specifies which element to return
    # Optional parameters, first_num and second_num, sepcify the first two numbers of the series - whether we're looking at a Fib or Lucas series


# Add block of code to test your functions - write a series of 'assert' statements to accomplish this
