# ClassRepoTemplate

This is a repo that serves as a template for a repository for a particular
instance of a class for th UWPCE Python Certificate.

A copy of this repo will be made for each class, so that it can be used by the class to share information and for students to submit their work.

## Structure of the repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

`examples`: Used to put example code, etc in for the class.

`solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises

`students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create a dir in the studetns dir in which to put their work.
