# Self_Paced-Online
Class repository for the self paced online class 2018


It can be used by the class to share information and for students to submit their work.

## Structure of the Repo

The class repo has three top level directories:

`examples`: Used to put example code, etc in for the class.

`solutions`: Used to post solutions to the exercises

`students`: Used for the students to submit their work. Each student will create a directory in the students directory in which to put their work.
